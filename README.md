# AI Article Summarizer

Article Summarizer Web App using OpenAI's GPT-4 API with Vite React App and Tailwind CSS

The goal of this project is to build a web application that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to automatically summarize long articles into shorter, more manageable summaries. The app will be built using the Vite React framework and will incorporate the Tailwind CSS library for styling.

Users can input the URL or copy-paste the article into the text box, and the app will use the GPT-4 API to generate a summary that will be displayed in a separate box on the page. The app will be publicly accessible, and there will be no authorization for users.

The app will use JavaScript to handle the API calls and to parse the JSON response from the GPT-4 API. Tailwind CSS will be used to style the components of the app, including the input box and summary box.

Overall, this project will provide an excellent opportunity to learn about natural language processing and modern web development techniques. It will also allow you to explore the capabilities of the OpenAI GPT-4 API and to create a useful tool that can save users time and effort when reading long articles.
